# VZV - varicella-zoster virus 
VZV, which is a DNA virus, is an alpha herpes virus that causes chickenpox and herpes zoster (shingles). After the primary infection, VZV stays in the body (in the sensory nerve ganglia) as a latent infection. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Reactivation of latent infection causes herpes zoster (shingles).
